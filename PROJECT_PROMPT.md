# My-Job Agent — Project Prompt & Resume File

**Purpose:** Autonomous job-search agent for Swarna Sekhar Dhar — scouts jobs,
tailors ATS PDF CV per job description, applies directly (JD-stated process →
company ATS → HR email → portal easy-apply last), tracks both-side history,
self-improves from outcomes.

## Resume rule
When the user opens Hermes in this folder (`~/projects/my-job-agent`) and says
**"continue"**, read this file's TODO and the docs below, then resume work.
On goodbye: update Progress + TODO here, commit on `dev`, `pull --rebase`,
push `origin/dev` — never skip even on interrupt.

## Key docs (source of truth — update BEFORE code when requirements change)
- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` — requirements analysis (FR-1…FR-12)
- `docs/PROJECT_DETAILS.md` — architecture, API surface, data model, status
- `docs/TODO.md` — progress tracker with blocked-on-user list

## Quick facts
- Stack: NestJS + TypeORM + MySQL `myjob_agent` (user `myjob_agent`),
  port **3010**, dashboard `/`, Swagger `/docs`
- Repo: github.com/methakon/my-job-agent, branch `dev`
- Run: `npm run build && node dist/main.js`
- Standards: MyLife MVCR, DTOs everywhere, one entity per table,
  conventional commits. Git sync after EVERY completed TODO item.

## Verified working (2026-08-25/26)
- Login/auth-free local service; profile 90% complete from ATS CV import
- Scout: Remotive + RemoteOK + Norway (englishjobs.no) live
- Naukri: login + search + APPLY END-TO-END VERIFIED — 7 real applications
  auto-submitted via cloudgateway apply-workflow
- Auto-apply loop LIVE (every 6h): leads ≥40% match, max 8/run, 90s pacing,
  kill-switch gates; RetryBackoffService retries failures at 5→10→20→30min
- Scorer hardened: title veto (designer/QA/sales never match), boilerplate
  stripped, title-hit-or-3-skills rule
- FR-13 HR-email deep investigation (job page → domain → career pages →
  pattern-guess+MX; pattern-guesses usable per user rule)
- Gmail SMTP send verified; IMAP OTP auto-read + recruiter reply polling
- ATS PDF CV builder: valid tailored 1-page PDF generated
- FR-15 Browser automation VERIFIED: playwright-core + system Chrome fills
  ATS forms, CV upload, stops before submit unless autoSubmit=true,
  screenshots to generated/browser/
- Side-income module: 5 researched opportunities + dashboard page at
  /side-income-dashboard/dashboard
- Dashboard at `/`, Swagger at `/docs`

## Credentials stored (encrypted AES-256 in mail_accounts table)
- Gmail app-password (bapay.9@gmail.com) — primary sender + OTP reader
- Naukri password (portal:naukri:bapay.9@gmail.com)

## TODO next session (in order)
1. **Wire BrowserFormService into apply engine fallback chain**: portal-only
   leads → browser-fill instead of failing; review-before-submit flow in
   dashboard (filled forms listed for one-click submit).
2. **finn.no adapter**: login flow (account exists, bapay.9@gmail.com;
   confirm password vs BankID with user) + scrape English jobs + apply.
3. **Self-improvement persistence**: store learning weights in DB table
   (channel success, keyword replies, best hour); wire outcome recording into
   applyDirect/email tracker.
4. Monster India adapter (same pattern as Naukri).
5. LinkedIn easy-apply via li_at cookie (toggle OFF by default).
6. Dashboard: add Mail accounts panel + interview-practice page + side-income
   link.
7. Outlook app-password (optional backup sender) — pending from user.
8. GitHub/portfolio URL for profile → completeness 100% — pending from user.

## Gotchas / lessons
- pdfkit must be required (not ES-imported): `const PDFDocument: any = require('pdfkit')`
- TypeORM can't infer types from `string | null` unions — always set explicit column type
- Naukri search needs BOTH nkparam header AND login cookies (appid 109/systemid Naukri)
- pkill kills our own shell sometimes — use targeted patterns or ss -tln to check port
